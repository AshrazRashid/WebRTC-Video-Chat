## Running on a Real Device

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your device and computer are on the same network
- For Android, enable USB debugging in Developer Options
- For iOS, ensure you have the correct permissions

### Steps to Run on a Real Device

1. **Start the Metro Bundler:**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the app on your device:**

   - **Android:**
     ```sh
     npm run android
     ```
   - **iOS:**
     ```sh
     npm run ios
     ```

3. **Open the Developer Menu on your device:**

   - **Android:** Shake the device or run:
     ```sh
     adb shell input keyevent 82
     ```
   - **iOS:** Shake the device or press `Cmd + D` (if connected to a Mac)

4. **Ensure the server is running:**

   - Navigate to the server directory:
     ```sh
     cd server
     ```
   - Install dependencies if not already done:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```sh
     node server.js
     ```

5. **Check the server IP address:**

   - Ensure the IP address in `.env` matches your computer's local IP
   - Update the IP if necessary and restart the Metro bundler and server

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If the app fails to connect to the server, ensure both the device and computer are on the same network
