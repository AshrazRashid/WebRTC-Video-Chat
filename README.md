This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Running the App on a Real Device

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your device and computer are on the same network.
- For Android, enable USB debugging in Developer Options.
- For iOS, ensure you have the correct permissions.

### Steps to Run on a Real Device

1. **Start the Metro Bundler:**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the app on your device:**

   - **Android:**
     ```sh
     npm run android
     ```
   - **iOS:**
     ```sh
     npm run ios
     ```

3. **Open the Developer Menu on your device:**

   - **Android:** Shake the device or run:
     ```sh
     adb shell input keyevent 82
     ```
   - **iOS:** Shake the device or press `Cmd + D` (if connected to a Mac).

4. **Ensure the server is running:**

   - Navigate to the server directory:
     ```sh
     cd server
     ```
   - Install dependencies if not already done:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```sh
     node server.js
     ```

5. **Check the server IP address:**

   - Ensure the IP address in `App.tsx` matches your computer's local IP.
   - Update the IP if necessary and restart the Metro bundler and server.

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If the app fails to connect to the server, ensure both the device and computer are on the same network.
   - Check for any firewall issues blocking port 3000.
   - Verify the server is running and accessible from the device's browser.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
